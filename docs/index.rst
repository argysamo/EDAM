EDAM
================================
Release v\ |version|. (:ref:`Installation <install>`)

EDAM (Environmental Data Acquisition Module), is a template framework that facilitates
timeseries data acquisition and integration. EDAM templates are written using programming
language-agnostic semantics, and can be reused both for input and output, thus enabling
data reuse via transformations across different formats.

Installation
------------

This project runs on **python3**. Thus, python3 should be installed.

.. warning:: It is highly recommended installing the module via Python virtual environment.

You can install and run this version. Issue the followings:

`pip install edam`

Above command installs `edam`, which will be available to the virtual environment.
It also creates an **.edam** folder in your system's home directory.
All EDAM related documents are located in this folder.
User drafted *template* and *metadata*, and *input* files should be put in this folder.

More information about the proposed workflow can be found in the proposed-workflow.
